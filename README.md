## 🔐 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/login` - Login (sends OTP)
- `POST /api/verify-otp` - Verify OTP for login
- `POST /api/verify-registration` - Verify email for registration

### Access Control (3 Objects)
- `POST /api/secure-access` - Secure data (Admin only)
- `POST /api/user-data` - User data (Admin + Moderator)
- `POST /api/system-config` - System config (Admin only)

### Security Features
- `POST /api/decrypt-data` - Decrypt encrypted data
- `POST /api/verify-signature` - Verify digital signature
- `GET /api/qr-code/:username` - Get QR code for OTP

## 👥 User Roles

### Admin
- Full system access
- Can access: Secure Data, User Data, System Config
- Can manage all users

### Moderator
- User management access
- Can access: User Data only
- Cannot access: Secure Data, System Config

### User
- Basic authenticated access
- Can access: Own profile only
- Cannot access: Any administrative functions

## 🔒 Security Features

### Password Security
- bcrypt hashing with salt (10 rounds)
- Minimum 6 characters
- Requires special character
- Account locking after 3 failed attempts

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Password (something you know)
- Email OTP (something you receive)
- OTP expires in 2 minutes
- Single-use OTPs

### Data Protection
- AES-256-CBC encryption for sensitive data
- RSA-SHA256 digital signatures for integrity
- Encrypted data storage in database
- Secure key management

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Server-side authorization checks
- Access control matrix implementation
- Policy-based access decisions

## 📚 Documentation

- **ACCESS_CONTROL_POLICY.md**: Complete access control policy with matrix
- **SECURITY_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Security levels, risks, attacks, and countermeasures
- **RUBRIC_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md**: Detailed rubric coverage analysis

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Users
Create users with different roles:
1. Admin user
2. Moderator user
3. Regular user

### Test Scenarios
1. Register → Verify Email → Login → Access Resources
2. Test access control for each role
3. Test encryption/decryption
4. Test digital signature verification
5. Test QR code generation

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Email Configuration**: If not configured, OTPs are displayed in console
- **Database**: SQLite database is created automatically
- **Keys**: RSA keys are generated automatically on first run
- **RSA keys are encrypted-at-rest**: Set `KEY_ENC_SECRET` before first run so RSA keys can be encrypted and later decrypted
- **Production**: This is a demonstration system. For production:
  - Use HTTPS
  - Implement rate limiting
  - Add comprehensive logging
  - Use secure key management
  - Regular security audits
